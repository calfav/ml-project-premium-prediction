## 📖 Overview  
This project implements a **predictive model** to estimate health insurance premiums based on:  
- Age  
- Smoking habits  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Medical history  

It was developed as a proof-of-concept (**Phase 1 MVP**) featuring:  
- A **97%+ accuracy ML model**  
- A **Streamlit web app** for underwriters  
- **Cloud deployment** for accessibility  

---

## 🎯 Features  
- Trains multiple models and selects the best-performing one  
- Cleaned & preprocessed dataset with **EDA** insights  
- Interactive **Streamlit UI** for real-time predictions  
- Secure & scalable **cloud deployment**  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn**  
- **Streamlit** (for web app)  
- **Cloud Deployment** (e.g., AWS / GCP / Azure)

## 📊 Results (Phase 1 MVP)  
- Model accuracy: **97%+**  
- 95% of predictions within **10% error margin**  
- Fully deployed **Streamlit app** for insurance premium prediction  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements (Phase 2)  
- Straight-through processing (**STP**) of insurance quotes  
- Advanced model monitoring & retraining pipeline  
- Integration with insurance databases and APIs
